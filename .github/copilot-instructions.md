# Copilot Instructions for `topbusanalise`

## Overview
`topbusanalise` is a project with limited documentation. This guide provides essential information to help AI coding agents contribute effectively.

## Project Structure
- The repository currently contains minimal files. The main entry point appears to be the `README.md`, which lacks detailed information.
- Additional files or directories may need to be created to support development workflows.

## Development Guidelines

### General Conventions
- Follow Pythonic conventions (PEP 8) for code style if Python is used.
- Use clear and descriptive commit messages.

### Suggested Workflow
1. **Explore the Codebase**: Identify key files and their purposes.
2. **Implement Features**: Write modular and reusable code.
3. **Testing**: Ensure all new code is covered by tests. If no testing framework is set up, consider adding one (e.g., `pytest` for Python).

### Integration Points
- If external APIs or services are required, document their usage clearly.
- Use environment variables for sensitive configurations.

## Recommendations for AI Agents
- When adding new functionality, ensure it aligns with the project's goals.
- If the project grows, consider introducing a clear folder structure (e.g., `src/`, `tests/`, `docs/`).
- Document all major changes in the `README.md` or a dedicated `CHANGELOG.md` file.

## Next Steps
- Populate the `README.md` with detailed project information, including purpose, setup instructions, and usage examples.
- Define a testing strategy and include a `tests/` directory.
- Add a `requirements.txt` or equivalent file to manage dependencies.
